# Privacy Policy

This Privacy Policy describes how the App ("we", "us", or "our") collects, uses, and discloses your information when you use our mobile application (the "App"). This standalone page is provided for Apple App Review.

## 1. Information Collection and Use

### Personal Data
The App allows you to create pregnancy profiles, which may include:
- Names
- Expected Delivery Dates

How this data is used:
- To calculate gestational age and track pregnancy progress
- To display profile lists

### Local Storage
All profile data (names and dates) is stored locally on your device using secure storage mechanisms. We do not upload this data to external servers or cloud services. You can delete this data at any time within the App.

## 2. Device Permissions

The App may request:
- Notifications: To remind you about pregnancy milestones (if enabled)

The App does not request camera or photo access since no images are stored.

## 3. Third-Party Services

We may use third-party services to support certain functionalities within the App. These may include:
- Update checking services: The App may send non-personal technical information (such as app version or device platform) to check for updates.
- Development frameworks or analytics tools: Some tools used to build the App may collect anonymous, non-personal diagnostic data like crash logs or performance metrics.

These services do not receive or access any profile data. We ensure all third-party services follow standard privacy and security practices.

## 4. Data Security

Since all data is stored locally on your device, its security depends on your device’s protection settings. We recommend enabling:
- Passcodes / PINs
- Biometrics (Face ID / Touch ID)
- Device encryption

## 5. Children’s Privacy

The App is not intended for children under 13. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13.

## 6. Changes to This Privacy Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy periodically. Any updates will be posted on this page.
